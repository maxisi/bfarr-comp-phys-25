    "# Identifying Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey) was a major multi-spectral imaging survey that began in 2000, observing over 1 billion objects over ~35% of the sky.  Many (most) of these objects appear as point sources, leaving photometric (i.e., brightness) and spectroscopic (i.e., color) measurements as the only way to distinguish objects of different types.  Detailed spectra of objects can allow for robust classification, but is resource-intensive.  Gross spectral features (i.e., color) can be assessed using filters, which allow photometry over narrower bands of wavelenghs than the CCD is sensitive to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The u, g, r, i, and z filters employed by SDSS:\n",

    "\n",
    "One astronomical objects SDSS proved useful in surveying is the quasar, an extremely active and luminous supermassive black hole in the center of a distant galaxy that's undergoing accretion.  As point sources, they are non-trivial to distinguish from other point sources in the survey, namely stars and white dwarfs in the Milky Way.  Confident classification can, and has, been done from spectral observations.  We'll use these confident spectroscopic classifications to train a logistic regression model to predict source classes based on the basic color information provided by SDSS's u, g, r, i, and z filters."
